Given a Book class and a Solution class, write a MyBook class that does the following:

Inherits from Book
Has a parameterized constructor taking these 3 parameters:
1. string title
2. string author
3. int price


Implements the Book class' abstract display() method so it prints these  lines:

1. Title:, a space, and then the current instance's title.
2. Author:, a space, and then the current instance's author.
3. Price:, a space, and then the current instance's price.

Note: Because these classes are being written in the same file, you must not use an access modifier (e.g.: public ) when declaring MyBook or your code will not execute.
